I know this has been done before, this one works on computers that block .vbs scripts like colleges and workplaced by using powershell.
This one sets the volume onto full and sets the video to fullscreen without the use of cmd or vbs scripts!
This will not work if powershell is blocked and you need an internet connection. :)
